To fix this, ensure that the parent element has a defined width.  You can achieve this through various methods such as setting a fixed width, using percentage widths, or using other layout mechanisms such as flexbox or grid.  Here's an example using a fixed width on the parent:

```css
.parent {
  width: 500px;
}

div {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
}
```

Alternatively, use flexbox or grid for more robust layout control:

```css
.parent {
  display: flex;
}

div {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
  flex: 1;
}
```
This ensures the `calc()` function has the necessary context to accurately calculate the width of the `div` element.
