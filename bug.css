The following CSS rule might cause unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div { width: calc(100% - 10px); }
```

The issue arises when the parent element of the `div` does not have a defined width.  `calc()` expressions rely on the context of the parent element's dimensions; if undefined, it could lead to incorrect calculations and unexpected layout.
